# ModalPopup Component for React

## Overview

The `ModalPopup` component is a reusable modal/dialogue window for React applications. It's a simple yet highly functional component that can be used for alerts, confirmations, or displaying additional information.

## Features

- **Conditional Rendering**: The modal only appears if the `isOpen` prop is set to true.
- **Flexible Content**: Accepts children components, making it easy to customize the content.
- **Close Functionality**: Closes when clicking outside the modal or on the close button.

## Installation

1. Download the `ModalPopup.js` component file and its associated `ModalPopup.css` file.
2. Place them in your project's component directory.

## Usage

```jsx
import ModalPopup from './path/to/ModalPopup';

<ModalPopup isOpen={yourBooleanState} onClose={yourCloseFunction}>
  Your modal content here
</ModalPopup>
```

## Props

- `isOpen` (Boolean): Determines whether the modal is open or not.
- `onClose` (Function): The function to call when the modal needs to be closed.
- `children` (Node): The content to display within the modal.
